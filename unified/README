pthread_lock - Pthread Mutex
control - Control
asymmetric - Asymmetric (Vasuvedan)
asymmetric_var - Asymmetric Variation
experiment - Function Pointer Passing
experiment2 - Asynchronous Function Pointer Passing
experiment3 - Message Passing
experiment4 - Integrated Spinlock
queues - Queue of Function Pointers
message_passing - Queue of Messages


Benchmarks can be run with the runbenchmarks.pl script.  It takes two arguments.  The first is either "h" or "l".  "h" runs with dominances 99.999% - 90% and "l" runs dominances 85% - 70%.  The second is an integer and represents the delay in the critical section.  e.g. "perl runbenchmarks.pl h 10"
